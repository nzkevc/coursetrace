# coursetrace
This project uses ASP.NET for the backend, with EF Core as the ORM, persisting data in a Azure SQL Database. It implements CRUD operations, which can be accessed in the frontend, a React Typescript project. The frontend uses MUI as its styling library, and is responsive to different screen sizes. It also uses React Router for routing, has switching between dark/light mode, and Git has been used throughout (pull requests, branches).
