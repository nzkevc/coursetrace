# Design Doc

I want this app to be a "course tracker" of some sort. The problem is that Canvas exists, and I find that it's a little bit hard to navigate sometimes. Things would probably be solved (for me) if students were allowed to modify the Canvas sections in the sidebar, but alas, they aren't. So, what should we do? Of course, recreate Canvas for the sole reason of being able to customise it to your liking and update it in a timely manner when the lecturers themselves aren't onto it. 

## Inspirations

I'm not much of a UI/UX person. And I don't mean that I'm not interested in it - I just don't have a lot of experience in it and don't really think about it too much. But there have been times when I've looked at things and thought - I really like this person's UI. Pretty much the only times I can remember that to happen is when I've watched YouTube videos and the Youtuber has spelled out/fed their reasoning to me like baby food. Tantacrul's redesign of MuseScore. (Someone)'s redesign of Steam and Spotify. The app I'm trying to make is trying to convey a clean, uncluttered, but detailed look into the course, assignments, and lectures that a uni student may be wanting to track during their time at university. 

## Ideas

* You should be able to add courses, assignments, and lectures to the app
* There should be a screen/section for each individual course, maybe a full degree overview, a screen for upcoming/past assignments, and upcoming/past lectures?
* The main functionality should be the addition of courses and assignments, and calculations of grades and what you need to get to maintain your grade because that shit IMPORTANT
* Maybe my inspiration is literally steam library. Or spotify playlists? You have a sidebar menu. You click on a course in the menu, and there's a dropdown for assignment and lectures and whatever the fuck you want. 
  + However, this fucking sucks because what if you want an overall view of courses or you want to compare courses huh???

## Drafts

I need a list of pages that I think I'll implement in this app. 

There are some keywords that I can use to create the routes, for examples: 
* dashboard
* courses
* assignments
* lectures
* compare
but it completely depends on how I want to show information to the user as that will influence the design.
